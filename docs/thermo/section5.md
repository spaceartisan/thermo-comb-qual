# Statistical Situations

Macrostate - Unique distribution of N particles across energy levels

Microstate - Unique quantum configuration (state) of the system, that belongs to a specific macrostate  

We are trying to determine all the possible ways $W$ particles/atoms can exist. Or

\[
    W(N_i)=\text{Number of microstates in specific macrostates}
\]

Following the constraints $N=\sum_i N_i^*$, $E=\sum_i \varepsilon_i N^*$


- Boltzmann statistics without degeneracy
- Boltzmann statistics with degeneracy
- Corrected Boltzmann statistic
- Bose-Einstein statistics
- Fermi-Dirac statistics (Pauli exclusion)

Boltzmann limit validity is when there are too many quatum states compared to number of particles.

Energy Level Population

\[
N_{i_{[FE/FD]}}^*=g_i\frac{e^{-\alpha-\beta\varepsilon_i}}{1\mp e^{-\alpha-\beta\varepsilon_i}}
\]

# Most Probably Energy Distribution

\[
\frac{N_i^*}{N}=\frac{g_ie^{-\beta\varepsilon_i}}{\sum_i g_ie^{-\beta\varepsilon_i}}=\frac{g_ie^{-\beta\varepsilon_i}}{Q}
\]

\[
\ln\Omega\approx\ln W_{max}=N\left(1+\ln\frac{Q}{N}\right)+\beta E
\]

# Entropy and Microstates

Relationship between entropy and number of places particles can be. If this is true, then there should be  relationship be our distribution of microstates and entropy

\[
S=\Phi(\Omega)
\]

With entropy extensive $S_{1+2}=S_1+S_2$ and number of microstates multiplicative $\Omega_{1+2}=\Omega_1\times\Omega_2$

Our form of entropy is

$S=a\ln\Omega+bN=k\ln\Omega+S_o$

This result required the postulate equal a priori, as in each microstate is as equally likely the the other.
